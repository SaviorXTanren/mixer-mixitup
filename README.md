# Mix It Up
A desktop client for handling chat, interactivity, and other streamer assistance features for Twitch, Trovo, and Glimesh.

## What is this?
Mix It Up is striving to be the "one stop shop" for all of your administrative needs when streaming. Mix It Up will allow you to handle chat commands, events, moderation, service connectivity, and more!

## How do I get started using it?
Go to http://mixitupapp.com for the latest release and check out https://wiki.mixitupapp.com/ for getting started information and detailed tutorials.

## I found a bug / have a feature request!
Please head to our Discord server for support & feature requests; the link can be found at the bottom of our website http://mixitupapp.com or in the About section of the app.

## I have a feature I want to implement myself & send a pull requset for!
Although we appreciate the desire, Mix It Up is not an open-contribution project. We have a large backlog of features we pull from for every update and attempt to group feature work together based on their area. If you're interested in seeing what we have on the backlog, you can check out our Trello board: https://trello.com/b/piWuuW4Y/feature-backlog
